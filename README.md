# learn_pygame

Welcome to my repository where I'm documenting my journey of learning the fundamentals of Pygame in Python. This repository serves as a place for me to track my progress, share my code, and showcase the projects I've built along the way. My goal is to understand the core concepts of game development. Thank you to ClearCode aka Christian for teaching me so much about pygame, please check him out using this Youtube Link.
